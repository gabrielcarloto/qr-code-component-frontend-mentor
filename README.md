## My process

### Built with

- [Astro](https://astro.build/)
- [React](https://reactjs.org/)

### What I learned

I started this challenge aiming to learn more about Astro, and I think I did it! Astro is really easy and fun to use, and also very fast. 

### Continued development

I didn't want to just do the challenge as it is basic, so I implemented a QR Code generator.

PS: I know there's a small issue with the downloaded QR Code in mobile, but I don't think I'll solve it because it is not my priority now.
